# Node Version Support

Currently, since I am rewriting this in Rust, this will support Node versions 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20. See [here](https://napi.rs/#support-matrix) for details.

This will also support the following platforms (hopefully):
- x86_64-pc-windows-msvc (or x86_64-pc-windows-gnu)
- i686-pc-windows-msvc (or i686-pc-windows-gnu)
- aarch64-pc-windows-msvc (or aarch64-pc-windows-gnu)
- x86_64-apple-darwin
- aarch64-apple-darwin
- universal-apple-darwin
- x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
- armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf
- aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
- x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
- aarch64-unknown-linux-musl
- armv7-linux-androideabi
- aarch64-linux-android
- x86_64-unknown-freebsd
