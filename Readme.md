# node-canvas

 Node canvas is a [Cairo](http://cairographics.org/) backed Canvas implementation for [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org).

## Authors

  - TJ Holowaychuk ([visionmedia](http://github.com/visionmedia))

## Installation

    $ npm install canvas

If not previously installed, you will want to install the [cairo graphics library](http://cairographics.org/download/) version _>= 1.8.6_ first using the package manager available to you, or building from source.

## Screencasts

  - [Introduction](http://screenr.com/CTk)

## Example

    var Canvas = require('canvas')
      , canvas = new Canvas(200,200)
      , ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
    
    
      ctx.font = '30px Impact';
      ctx.rotate(.1);
      ctx.fillText("Awesome!", 50, 100);
    
      var te = ctx.measureText('Awesome!');
      ctx.strokeStyle = 'rgba(0,0,0,0.5)';
      ctx.beginPath();
      ctx.lineTo(50, 102);
      ctx.lineTo(50 + te.width, 102);
      ctx.stroke();
      
      console.log('<img src="' + canvas.toDataURL() + '" />');

## Non-Standard API

 Due to interfacing with existing node internals such as I/O node-canvas includes a non-standard API which is shown below.

### Canvas#createPNGStream()

  To create a `PNGStream` simple call `canvas.createPNGStream()`, and the stream will start to emit _data_ events, finally emitting _end_ when finished. If an exception occurs the _error_ event is emitted.
  
    var fs = require('fs')
      , out = fs.createWriteStream(__dirname + '/text.png')
      , stream = canvas.createPNGStream();

    stream.on('data', function(chunk){
      out.write(chunk);
    });
    
    stream.on('end', function(){
      console.log('saved png');
    });

### Canvas#toBuffer()

  A call to `Canvas#toBuffer()` will return a node `Buffer` instance containing all of the PNG data.

## Benchmarks

 Although node-canvas is extremely new, and we have not even begun optimization yet it is already quite fast. For benchmarks vs other node canvas implementations view this [gist](https://gist.github.com/664922), or update the submodules and run `$ make benchmark` yourself.

## Contribute

 Want to contribute to node-canvas? patches for features, bug fixes, documentation, examples and others are certainly welcome. Take a look at the [issue queue](https://github.com/LearnBoost/node-canvas/issues) for existing issues.

## Examples

 Examples are placed in _./examples_, be sure to check them out! most produce a png image of the same name, and others such as _live-clock.js_ launch an http server to be viewed in the browser.

## Testing

If you have not previously, init git submodules:

    $ git submodule update --init

Build node-canvas:

    $ node-waf configure build

Unit tests:

    $ make test

Visual tests:

    $ make test-server

## Versions

Tested with:

  - node 0.2.4
  - cairo 1.8.6
