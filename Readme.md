# node-canvas

 Node canvas is a [Cairo](http://cairographics.org/) backed Canvas implementation for [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org).

## Authors

  - TJ Holowaychuk ([visionmedia](http://github.com/visionmedia))

## Installation

    $ npm install canvas

If not previously installed, you will want to install the [cairo graphics library](http://cairographics.org/download/) version _>= 1.8.6_ first using the package manager available to you, or [building from source](https://github.com/LearnBoost/node-canvas/wiki/_pages).

## Screencasts

  - [Introduction](http://screenr.com/CTk)

## Example

```javascript
var Canvas = require('canvas')
  , canvas = new Canvas(200,200)
  , ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

ctx.font = '30px Impact';
ctx.rotate(.1);
ctx.fillText("Awesome!", 50, 100);

var te = ctx.measureText('Awesome!');
ctx.strokeStyle = 'rgba(0,0,0,0.5)';
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.lineTo(50, 102);
ctx.lineTo(50 + te.width, 102);
ctx.stroke();

console.log('<img src="' + canvas.toDataURL() + '" />');
```

## Non-Standard API

 node-canvas extends the canvas API to provide interfacing with node, for example streaming PNG data, converting to a `Buffer` instance, etc. Among the interfacing API, in some cases the drawing API has been extended for SSJS image manipulation / creation usage, however keep in mind these additions may fail to render properly within browsers.

### Image#src=Buffer

 node-canvas adds `Image#src=Buffer` support, allowing you to read images from disc, redis, etc and apply them via `ctx.drawImage()`. Below we draw scaled down squid png by reading it from the disk with node's I/O.

```javascript
fs.readFile(__dirname + '/images/squid.png', function(err, squid){
  if (err) throw err;
  img = new Image;
  img.src = squid;
  ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0, img.width / 4, img.height / 4);
});
```

 Below is an example of a canvas drawing it-self as the source several time:

```javascript
var img = new Image;
img.src = canvas.toBuffer();
ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0, 50, 50);
ctx.drawImage(img, 50, 0, 50, 50);
ctx.drawImage(img, 100, 0, 50, 50);
```

### Canvas#createPNGStream()

  To create a `PNGStream` simple call `canvas.createPNGStream()`, and the stream will start to emit _data_ events, finally emitting _end_ when finished. If an exception occurs the _error_ event is emitted.

```javascript
var fs = require('fs')
  , out = fs.createWriteStream(__dirname + '/text.png')
  , stream = canvas.createPNGStream();

stream.on('data', function(chunk){
  out.write(chunk);
});

stream.on('end', function(){
  console.log('saved png');
});
```

Currently _only_ sync streaming is supported, however we plan on supporting async streaming as well (of course :) ). Until then the `Canvas#toBuffer(callback)` alternative is async utilizing `eio_custom()`.

### Canvas#toBuffer()

A call to `Canvas#toBuffer()` will return a node `Buffer` instance containing all of the PNG data.

```javascript
canvas.toBuffer();
```

### Canvas#toBuffer() async

Optionally we may pass a callback function to `Canvas#toBuffer()`, and this process will be performed asynchronously, and will `callback(err, buf)`.

```javascript
canvas.toBuffer(function(err, buf){

});
```

### Canvas#toDataURL() async

Optionally we may pass a callback function to `Canvas#toDataURL()`, and this process will be performed asynchronously, and will `callback(err, str)`.

```javascript
canvas.toDataURL(function(err, str){

});
```

or specify the mime type:

```javascript
canvas.toDataURL('image/png', function(err, str){

});
```

### CanvasRenderingContext2d#patternQuality

Given one of the values below will alter pattern (gradients, images, etc) render quality, defaults to _good_.

  - fast
  - good
  - best

### Global Composite Operations

In addition to those specified and commonly implemented by browsers, the following have been added:

  - multiply
  - screen
  - overlay
  - hard-light
  - soft-light
  - hsl-hue
  - hsl-saturation
  - hsl-color
  - hsl-luminosity

## Anti-Aliasing

 Set anti-aliasing mode

 - default
 - none
 - gray
 - subpixel

 For example:

```javascript
ctx.antialias = 'none';
```

## Benchmarks

 Although node-canvas is extremely new, and we have not even begun optimization yet it is already quite fast. For benchmarks vs other node canvas implementations view this [gist](https://gist.github.com/664922), or update the submodules and run `$ make benchmark` yourself.

## Contribute

 Want to contribute to node-canvas? patches for features, bug fixes, documentation, examples and others are certainly welcome. Take a look at the [issue queue](https://github.com/LearnBoost/node-canvas/issues) for existing issues.

## Examples

 Examples are placed in _./examples_, be sure to check them out! most produce a png image of the same name, and others such as _live-clock.js_ launch an http server to be viewed in the browser.

## Testing

If you have not previously, init git submodules:

    $ git submodule update --init

Build node-canvas:

    $ node-waf configure build

Unit tests:

    $ make test

Visual tests:

    $ make test-server

## Versions

Tested with and designed for:

  - node 0.4.2
  - cairo 1.8.6

For node 0.2.x `node-canvas` <= 0.4.3 may be used,
0.5.0 and above are designed for node 0.4.x only.
