## Installation

```bash
$ npm install canvas
```

Unless previously installed you'll _need_ __Cairo__. For system-specific installation view the [Wiki](https://github.com/LearnBoost/node-canvas/wiki/_pages).

You can quickly install Cairo and its dependencies for OS X using the one liner below:

```bash
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LearnBoost/node-canvas/master/install -O - | sh
```

or if you use MacPorts

```bash
sudo port install pkgconfig libpng giflib freetype libpixman cairo
```

## Example

```javascript
var Canvas = require('canvas')
  , Image = Canvas.Image
  , canvas = new Canvas(200, 200)
  , ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

ctx.font = '30px Impact';
ctx.rotate(.1);
ctx.fillText("Awesome!", 50, 100);

var te = ctx.measureText('Awesome!');
ctx.strokeStyle = 'rgba(0,0,0,0.5)';
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.lineTo(50, 102);
ctx.lineTo(50 + te.width, 102);
ctx.stroke();

console.log('<img src="' + canvas.toDataURL() + '" />');
```

## Non-Standard API

 node-canvas extends the canvas API to provide interfacing with node, for example streaming PNG data, converting to a `Buffer` instance, etc. Among the interfacing API, in some cases the drawing API has been extended for SSJS image manipulation / creation usage, however keep in mind these additions may fail to render properly within browsers.

### Image#src=Buffer

 node-canvas adds `Image#src=Buffer` support, allowing you to read images from disc, redis, etc and apply them via `ctx.drawImage()`. Below we draw scaled down squid png by reading it from the disk with node's I/O.

```javascript
fs.readFile(__dirname + '/images/squid.png', function(err, squid){
  if (err) throw err;
  img = new Image;
  img.src = squid;
  ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0, img.width / 4, img.height / 4);
});
```

 Below is an example of a canvas drawing it-self as the source several time:

```javascript
var img = new Image;
img.src = canvas.toBuffer();
ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0, 50, 50);
ctx.drawImage(img, 50, 0, 50, 50);
ctx.drawImage(img, 100, 0, 50, 50);
```

### Image#dataMode

node-canvas adds `Image#dataMode` support, which can be used to opt-in to mime data tracking of images (currently only JPEGs).

When mime data is tracked, in PDF mode JPEGs can be embedded directly into the output, rather than being re-encoded into PNG. This can drastically reduce filesize, and speed up rendering.

```javascript
var img = new Image;
img.dataMode = Image.MODE_IMAGE; // Only image data tracked
img.dataMode = Image.MODE_MIME; // Only mime data tracked
img.dataMode = Image.MODE_MIME | Image.MODE_IMAGE; // Both are tracked
```

If image data is not tracked, and the Image is drawn to an image rather than a PDF canvas, the output will be junk. Enabling mime data tracking has no benefits (only a slow down) unless you are generating a PDF.

### Canvas#pngStream()

  To create a `PNGStream` simply call `canvas.pngStream()`, and the stream will start to emit _data_ events, finally emitting _end_ when finished. If an exception occurs the _error_ event is emitted.

```javascript
var fs = require('fs')
  , out = fs.createWriteStream(__dirname + '/text.png')
  , stream = canvas.pngStream();

stream.on('data', function(chunk){
  out.write(chunk);
});

stream.on('end', function(){
  console.log('saved png');
});
```

Currently _only_ sync streaming is supported, however we plan on supporting async streaming as well (of course :) ). Until then the `Canvas#toBuffer(callback)` alternative is async utilizing `eio_custom()`.

### Canvas#jpegStream() and Canvas#syncJPEGStream()

You can likewise create a `JPEGStream` by calling `canvas.jpegStream()` with
some optional parameters; functionality is otherwise identical to
`pngStream()`. See `examples/crop.js` for an example.

_Note: At the moment, `jpegStream()` is the same as `syncJPEGStream()`, both
are synchronous_

```javascript
var stream = canvas.jpegStream({
    bufsize: 4096 // output buffer size in bytes, default: 4096
  , quality: 75 // JPEG quality (0-100) default: 75
  , progressive: false // true for progressive compression, default: false
});
```

### Canvas#toBuffer()

A call to `Canvas#toBuffer()` will return a node `Buffer` instance containing all of the PNG data.

```javascript
canvas.toBuffer();
```

### Canvas#toBuffer() async

Optionally we may pass a callback function to `Canvas#toBuffer()`, and this process will be performed asynchronously, and will `callback(err, buf)`.

```javascript
canvas.toBuffer(function(err, buf){

});
```

### Canvas#toDataURL() async

Optionally we may pass a callback function to `Canvas#toDataURL()`, and this process will be performed asynchronously, and will `callback(err, str)`.

```javascript
canvas.toDataURL(function(err, str){

});
```

or specify the mime type:

```javascript
canvas.toDataURL('image/png', function(err, str){

});
```

### CanvasRenderingContext2d#patternQuality

Given one of the values below will alter pattern (gradients, images, etc) render quality, defaults to _good_.

  - fast
  - good
  - best
  - nearest
  - bilinear

### CanvasRenderingContext2d#textDrawingMode

Can be either `path` or `glyph`. Using `glyph` is much faster than `path` for drawing, and when using a PDF context will embed the text natively, so will be selectable and lower filesize. The downside is that cairo does not have any subpixel precision for `glyph`, so this will be noticeably lower quality for text positioning in cases such as rotated text. Also, strokeText in `glyph` will act the same as fillText, except using the stroke style for the fill.

Defaults to _path_.

This property is tracked as part of the canvas state in save/restore.

### CanvasRenderingContext2d#filter

Like `patternQuality`, but applies to transformations effecting more than just patterns. Defaults to _good_.

  - fast
  - good
  - best
  - nearest
  - bilinear

### Global Composite Operations

In addition to those specified and commonly implemented by browsers, the following have been added:

  - multiply
  - screen
  - overlay
  - hard-light
  - soft-light
  - hsl-hue
  - hsl-saturation
  - hsl-color
  - hsl-luminosity

## Anti-Aliasing

 Set anti-aliasing mode

 - default
 - none
 - gray
 - subpixel

 For example:

```javascript
ctx.antialias = 'none';
```

## PDF Support

  Basic PDF support was added in 0.11.0. Make sure to install cairo with `--enable-pdf=yes` for the PDF backend. node-canvas must know that it is creating
  a PDF on initialization, using the "pdf" string:

```js
var canvas = new Canvas(200, 500, 'pdf');
```

 An additional method `.addPage()` is then available to create
 multiple page PDFs:

```js
ctx.font = '22px Helvetica';
ctx.fillText('Hello World', 50, 80);
ctx.addPage();

ctx.font = '22px Helvetica';
ctx.fillText('Hello World 2', 50, 80);
ctx.addPage();

ctx.font = '22px Helvetica';
ctx.fillText('Hello World 3', 50, 80);
ctx.addPage();
```

## SVG support

 Just like PDF support, make sure to install cairo with `--enable-svg=yes`.
 You also need to tell node-canvas that it is working on SVG upon its initialization:

```js
var canvas = new Canvas(200, 500, 'svg');
// Use the normal primitives.
fs.writeFile('out.svg', canvas.toBuffer());
```

## Benchmarks

 Although node-canvas is extremely new, and we have not even begun optimization yet it is already quite fast. For benchmarks vs other node canvas implementations view this [gist](https://gist.github.com/664922), or update the submodules and run `$ make benchmark` yourself.

## Contribute

 Want to contribute to node-canvas? patches for features, bug fixes, documentation, examples and others are certainly welcome. Take a look at the [issue queue](https://github.com/LearnBoost/node-canvas/issues) for existing issues.

## Examples

 Examples are placed in _./examples_, be sure to check them out! most produce a png image of the same name, and others such as _live-clock.js_ launch an http server to be viewed in the browser.

## Testing

If you have not previously, init git submodules:

    $ git submodule update --init

Install the node modules:

    $ npm install

Build node-canvas:

    $ node-gyp rebuild

Unit tests:

    $ make test

Visual tests:

    $ make test-server

## Versions

Tested with and designed for:

  - node 0.4.2
  - cairo 1.8.6

For node 0.2.x `node-canvas` <= 0.4.3 may be used,
0.5.0 and above are designed for node 0.4.x only.
